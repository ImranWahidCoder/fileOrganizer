Lab 1 (Temperature measurement using thermocouple)
__________________________________________________


Q))What is thermocouple?

Ans)) --> A thermocouple is an electrical device consisting of two dissimilar electrical conductors forming an electrical junction. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage as a result of Seebeck effect, and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are widely used as temperature sensors.

Q))What is Seebeck effect?
Ans)) --> The Seebeck effect is the electromotive force (emf) that develops across two points of an electrically conducting material when there is a temperature difference between them. The emf is called the Seebeck emf (or thermo/thermal/thermoelectric emf). The ratio between the emf and temperature difference is the Seebeck coefficient. A thermocouple measures the difference in potential across a hot and cold end for two dissimilar materials. This was because the electron energy levels shifted differently in the different metals, creating a potential difference between the junctions which in turn created an electrical current


Lab 3 (LVDT characteristics Module)

LVDT ==> Linear variable differential transformer
It is an inductive transducer which helps to measure the displacement in terms of voltage
It converts the linear motion in to electrical signal

Construction:-
--------------
1. Single primary winding p
2. Two secondary winding s1 and s2
3. Wound on a cylindrical former
4. Equal number of turns in s1 and s2 and they're placed at equal distance from 'p'
5. Primary winding is connected to an alternating current source.
6. Soft iron core is placed inside the former.
7. Displacement to be measured is applied on the soft iron. 

Soft iron is made up of high permeability nickel hydrogen annealed iron . because it helps to have low harmonics and low null voltage. 

Output of the LVDT will be the voltage difference between the two secondary windings

Working principle:- 
--------------------
Primary winding is excited by an alternating current source. This will generate an electromagnetic field and and this field will induce and an alternating volage in secondary windings . 
Say the induced voltages are Es1 and Es2 (primary and secondary)
Output = Es1-Es2
1. When the iron core is at the null position (i.e when displacement is 0) the equal amount of flux will be linked to both the secondary windings. So Es1==Es2 and the output = 0 
2. When the iron core is moved towards the left , the flux linked with the left secondary winding will be more so Es1 >Es2 . so the output voltage will be Es1-Es2. 
3. When the iron core is moved towards the right , the flux linked with the right secondary winding will be more so Es2 >Es1 . so the output voltage will be Es2-Es1.

Capacitive transducers works on the principle of change in capacitance which may be caused by
1. Change in the overlapping area 
2. Change in the dielectric medium
3. Change in the distance between the plates

What is multi-vibrator ?
-----------------------
Multi-vibrator is an electronic device which is used to implement two state devices such as flip-flop, oscillators, timer. Here state means logic high state ( high voltage ) and logic low state( low voltage ). 
There are 3 types of multivibrators 
1. Astable multi-vibrator:- In this type of multi-vibrator the output is not stable in either of the states . The output toggles between the high and low states . The time for which the output remains in any of the states is determined by the passive components like R and C. 
2. Monostable multi-vibrator:- OUtput is stable only in one state. Output will remain in the stable state unless and untill some external triggering pulse is applied on that. When triggering pulse is applied, the output goes to the unstable state and the time period for which it remains in the unstable state depends upon the passive components like R and C.
3. Bistable multi-vibrator:- Output is stable in both the states.
